# odin-recipes
This project  is a website where I introduce three recipes of my selection with a very descriptive step-by-step guide on how to make them, including a brief description of each recipe and its respective ingredients list.

This project allows me to showcase development skills such as: git (terminal, stage, commit, push, commit messages); creating relative links, embedding images through absolute links, and creating ordered and unordered lists.
